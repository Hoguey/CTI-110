# Calculate the distance the car will travel for each variable


# Formula

speed = 70

distanceAfter6 = 6

distanceAfter10 = 10

distanceAfter15 = 15


print ('distance is', distanceAfter6)

print ('distance is', distanceAfter10)

print ('distance is', distanceAfter15)

speed * distanceAfter6 = distance

speed * distanceAfter10 = distance

speed * distanceAfter15 = distance
